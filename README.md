# PyTorch_07_CV

** PyTorch Computer Vision**
Computer vision is the art of teaching a computer to see.
For example, it could involve building a model to classify whether a photo is of a cat or a dog (binary classification).

** Computer vision libraries in PyTorch**

* torchvision

Contains datasets, model architectures and image transformations often used for computer vision problems.

* torchvision.datasets

Here you'll find many example computer vision datasets for a range of problems from image classification, object detection, image captioning, video classification and more. It also contains a series of base classes for making custom datasets.

* torchvision.models

This module contains well-performing and commonly used computer vision model architectures implemented in PyTorch, you can use these with your own problems.

*  torchvision.transforms

Often images need to be transformed (turned into numbers/processed/augmented) before being used with a model, common image transformations are found here.

*  torch.utils.data.Dataset

Base dataset class for PyTorch.

* torch.utils.data.DataLoader

Creates a Python iterable over a dataset (created with torch.utils.data.Dataset).
